This package provides a graphical user interface to predict and visualize chromatin accessibility using singe-cell RNA-seq. scBIRD is also available online at 

## Installation

scBIRD can be installed from github:

``` r
devtools::install_github("liyueyikate/scBIRD")
```

## Example

To launch the graphical user interface, run the following command in R:
